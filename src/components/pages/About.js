      <p>
        I am currently pursuing a full stack web development certification to further enhance my career in the IT field.  
        Additionally, I have chosen to pursue this course because I enjoy the concepts of coding and creating websites. I have
        been intrigued by the process of web page development and now have a better understanding of the complexity

        my personality suits perfectly for me to embrace this as a career.  The investment of my time to pursue this rigourous course speaks to
        the determination I have to find success in this field.
